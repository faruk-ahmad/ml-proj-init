# ML-PROJ-INIT
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------
#### A lightweight tool to create machine learning project structure and add neaty code snipt quickly to your project

-----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------

<p align= "justify">
  
__ml-proj-init__ is a python package to help you to do your machine learning experiment in pythonn in a faster way by creating well defined project structure just by a few commands that works out of the box for most of the machine learning projects. You can focus on building the solution of your problem rather writing all the basic stuffs that are tedious but can be added to your project easily and in a faster way.

#### 2.1.1 Installation

* Install using the following command-

```bash
pip3 install ml-proj-init
```


#### 2.1.2 Uninstallation

* Uninstall using the following command

```bash
pip3 uninstall ml-proj-init
```

* Provide "y" if you are prompt for approval to remove some config files.

--------------------------------------------------

## 4. Getting Started

--------------------------------------------------

ML-PROJ-INIT has two mode

1. Create structure mode
2. Add class/code snipt mode

-- In create mode, you can create a well defined project structure for your machine learning or deep learning project by passing few arguments.

#### 4.1 Creating project structure

The create structure mode supports the following parameters - 



|	Parameter		|		Accepted Values		|		Usage					|
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
|	-m  or --mode		|		c = create			|		To express create mode		|
|	-n or --name		|	string, a valid project name	|		Provide the project name	|
|	-p or --path		|	string, a valid path 		|		Path to create the project	|


## 5. Features
--------------------------------------------------

#### 5.1 Features avaiable

* Creating machine learning project structure based on popular ml library scikit-learn
* Creating deep learning project structure using popular dl library tensorflow and keras
* Adding necessary code snipts for data loader class like image data loader or text data loader.
* Adding different neural network implementation skeleton in popular deep learning library TF/KERAS.

#### 5.2 Features in Queue

* Adding more frequently used implementation for quick experiment
* Adding more implementatioin of NN architecture for experiment
* Adding more flexible and dynamic code snipt generation.
